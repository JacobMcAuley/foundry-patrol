## [1.2.1] - 2020-05-09

### Added
- Token rotation: Allows tokens to face towards the direction of their next route. Good for topdown tokens!
- Global key configuration: You can now configure what keybinding you would like to use for your route start/stop
- Disable HUD option: You can now disble the tokenPatroller HUD if you want to clear the clutter. Keybindings still work
- API calling available: Namespaced under TP
    - TP.tokenPatroller.startPatrol(delay: string, tokenId: string)
    - TP.tokenPatroller.stopPatrol(tokenId: string)
    - TP.tokenPatroller.addPlotPoint(tokenId: string) // Takes the tokens current position as a point.


### Changed
- Token paths have been changed from system settings to a file. This will prevent unintentional bogging down of system resources on setting updates. 
- Previously, when token routes were longer than the delay, the token would change directions mid-cycle. That has been changed and the delay will only begin after the token has stopped moving.

### Bug Fixes
- Issue where 'X' would show on a token after a reboot (if the token was moving prior to the restart) has been fixed.
- Fixed a bug where deleting a token didn't remove corresponding token path data resulting in a massively growing data file.

## Known Issue:
- Activating another scene while tokens are moving will result in a unique error where the active scene indicator will no longer function
  Scenes will still change and work as expected, but the active indicator will not update. This is a issue with core, as the issue persists still occurs with the module disabled
