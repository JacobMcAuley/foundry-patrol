# Foundry Token Patrol
This module allows GMs (and optionally players) to set patrol points for their tokens, making the tokens move between the set points without input.


### Reasoning

Using this mod, you will be able to set up "Patrol Routes" which tokens will move to based on a timing of your choice. This can give certain scenes a more life like appearance! Make your markets full of life and give your castles that patrolling retinue they've always needed!

### FVTT Version
- Tested on FVTT v0.3.7

### IMPORTANT / BUGS

Bugs are inevitable, despite my best efforts to remove all that I could find. If you happen to locate any or if something doesn't appear to work as inteded, please don't hesitate to contact me on Discord at (JacobMcAuley#3461). I will correct the issue and push it out as soon as possible.

That being said here are all the known issues at the moment:
1. Group selecting tokens for deletion while patrolling is active *sometimes* results in an error message occuring. Hit F5 to refresh to fix.
