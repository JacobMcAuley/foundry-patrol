# Foundry Token Patrol

This module allows GMs (and optionally players) to set patrol points for their tokens, making the tokens move between the set points without input. Foundry Patrol offers a wide variety of features! I highly recommend watching the linked video below for a demonstration. The video is long, but you're welcome to skip through it or watch it at max speed!

### Reasoning

Using this mod, you will be able to set up "Patrol Routes" which tokens will move to based on a timing of your choice. This can give certain scenes a more life like appearance! Make your markets full of life and give your castles that patrolling retinue they've always needed!

### FVTT Version

-   Tested on FVTT v0.5.5
-   No known module incompatibilities.

### IMPORTANT / BUGS

**Remember to back up your world before using mods**

Bugs are inevitable, despite my best efforts to remove all that I could find. If you happen to locate any or if something doesn't appear to work as intended, please don't hesitate to contact me on Discord at (JacobMcAuley#3461). I will correct the issue and push it out as soon as possible.

That being said here are all the known issues at the moment:

1. Group selecting tokens for deletion while patrolling is active _sometimes_ results in an error message occuring. Hit F5 to refresh to fix.
2. Games with two or more GM or assistant permissions will find unexpected behavior.

### It's a feature not a bug!

1. Tokens moving through linear mode on a diagonal may take an unexpect route to reach the point. This is how the function currently works. Future updates will adjust this.
