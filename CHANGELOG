## [2.0.3] - 2020-05-16

### Added
- Added a setting to pause tokens on combat start.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the quote parser would try to parse an empty array
- Fixed an issue where tokens would say "UNDEFINED" if no quote was given.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-05-16

### Added
- Token settings: Tokens now have a down caret on the hud. This will open a token patrol menu for all your needs
    - Settings option
    - Quote options
    - Vision options --> Note: A small radius size will cause strange issue. I'd advise 20 >= 
    - Audio options
- Disable HUD option: You can now disble the tokenPatroller HUD if you want to clear the clutter, the caret still remains. Keybindings still work
- Quotes: Quotes are now an option! Using this feature will make tokens speak as they patrol their route. If vision mode is enabled, special quotes will be played when seen!
- Vision: Tokens can now be given optional vision to start combat when players are seen, say something when a player enters the range, or even stop the route!
- Audio: A moving audio range can be set up to follow the token on it's route, that way you can create footsteps, flying, or other noises creatures may make. 
- Token rotation: Allows tokens to face towards the direction of their next route. Good for topdown tokens! This comes in both a global form and individual level
- Global key configuration: You can now configure what keybinding you would like to use for your route start/stop
- API calling available: Namespaced under TP these are good for macros!
    - TP.tokenPatroller.startPatrol(delay: string, tokenId: string)
    - TP.tokenPatroller.stopPatrol(tokenId: string)
    - TP.tokenPatroller.addPlotPoint(tokenId: string) // Takes the tokens current position as a point.


### Changed
- Token paths have been changed from system settings to a file. This will prevent unintentional bogging down of system resources on setting updates. 
- Previously, when token routes were longer than the delay, the token would change directions mid-cycle. That has been changed and the delay will only begin after the token has stopped moving.
- When using hot keys, selecting tokens will affect only the selected tokens. If no tokens are selected, then it is applied to all tokens.


### Bug Fixes
- Issue where 'X' would show on a token after a reboot (if the token was moving prior to the restart) has been fixed.
- Fixed a bug where deleting a token didn't remove corresponding token path data resulting in a massively growing data file.

## Known Issue:
- Activating another scene while tokens are moving will result in a unique error where the active scene indicator will no longer function
  Scenes will still change and work as expected, but the active indicator will not update. This is a issue with core, as the issue persists still occurs with the module disabled
